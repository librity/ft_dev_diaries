## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

About a month ago I began my journey at [42 S Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).
I started writing daily updates and sharing them with my squad. They're full of
beginner-friendly tips about 42's projects and coding in general.

A friend told me I should post these online for posterty's sake. I was
studying GO the other night and I came across a new static site generator
called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so I thought I'd give it a shot.

## üõ∏ 42 S√£o Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers and classes.
- Students learn by cooperating
  and correcting each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- Its focus is as much on social skills as it is on technical skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process -
  [**The Piscine**](https://42.fr/en/admissions/42-piscine/)

It's an amazing school, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.
