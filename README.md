## About <a name = "about"></a>

Ever since I started studying at 42 S Paulo I write daily updates on my
progress and share them with my squad. They usually contain beginner-friendly
tips about the project I'm currently doing and about programming in general.

A friend suggested I should post these updates online for posterty's sake. I was
also studying GO and I came across the static site generator
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so I thought I'd give it a shot.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

All you need to get started is the latetes Hugo executable somewhere in your path.

$ brew install hugo
# Ubuntu/Debian
$ sudo apt-get install hugo
# Windows
$ choco install hugo-extended -confirm
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
