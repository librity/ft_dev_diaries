I really like code for some reason.

A friend told me I should post these online for posterty's sake. I was
studying GO the other night and I came across a new static site generator
called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so I thought I'd give it a shot.

Every single day I'll write an update and post it here:

- What I did yesterday
- What am I going to do today
- What was my biggest impediment
