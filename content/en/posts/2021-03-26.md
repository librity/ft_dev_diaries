Yesterday I started the
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
challenge and I'm enjoying it a lot.
It cuts through a lot of the fluff without dumbing it down too much:
I'm 3 chapters in and I'm already generating gradients and tracing spheres.

All the code I've written so far can be found in this
[repo](https://github.com/librity/weekendrt).
I have a gallery full of eye candy, and I'm always adding new pictures.

I also made a `.bmp` library in C based on the
[Purdue University tutorial](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece264/17au/hw/HW15)
and
[Marc Dickmann's library](https://github.com/marc-q/libbmp).
Mine's a lot simpler, since I just need to save the generated Image to a file.

It was a bit of a pain getting the bitmap's header bits right,
but I learned a lot about file manipulation in C.
It'll pay off in the future, since saving the images as bitmaps
is about 10% of the final project.
