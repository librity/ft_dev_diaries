Yesterday I did some ReactJS challenges from my bootcamp.

Today I woke up early and corrected 4 rush projects
from the ongoing basecamp at 42 SÃ£o Paulo.
It was great to meet all the campers and review their projects.
I always try to refactor their code and teach them as many tricks as I can.

I'm doing the new Elixir module.
