Yesterday I continued studying about printf. It makes several `conversions` that we will have to implement, and for each` conversions` we still have to consider the flags (example: `% 06.2f`,`% 15.10s` and `% * d`). Initially I will structure my code in two parts:

1. I will verify that the number of arguments passed corresponds to the number of `conversions` in the format string, and return an error (` -1`) otherwise.
2. Perocrrate the format string, writing each character until it reaches a `conversion`. For each `conversion` I will generate a method that creates an allocated and properly formatted string: from there it is only to write the string, add the length in the character count and free the memory.

I chose to do this because it is simple, I will allocate as little memory as possible (avoid memory leaks), and I can reuse various libft functions. Base me on section 7.3 of `The Ansi C Programming Language`, where they give an example of printf with this structure.

My original idea was to do with split and join in the format string, which would require doing some crazy checks between strings, in addition to the question of memory.

I also learned about how to check typing in C. I am in doubt if we need to check if the types of the parameters match the format string: Do I need to return an error in `ft_printf ("% s ", 42);`?

Finally, I added github actions to my project, which automatically run testers in macos whenever I push the master. I based myself on this repository:

Today I will continue the printf, starting with the makefile.

My biggest obstacle is still the netwhat retry time.
