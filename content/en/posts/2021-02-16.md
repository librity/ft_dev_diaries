Yesterday I talked to @rdutenke, who answered all my questions about `get_next_line`:
_Now I know that read advances the poetry in the file descriptor automatically._
The "cat jump" for this project is to use a static pointer as a buffer, allocated with `BUFFER_SIZE + 1`: this way we can pass it to` read` and treat the different cases:

1. If the read buffer does not have `'\ n'` or` EOF`, we concatenate with the previous buffer and call `read` again.
2. If the read buffer has `'\ n'` we concatenate with the previous buffer up to`' \ n'`.
3. If the buffer read has `EOF`, we concatenate it with the previous buffer up to` EOF`.
4. Finally, we have to point the `line` pointer passed to an allocated string that contains the entire line without the` '\ n'`. Then we release the memory allocated in the intermediate strings and return `1` or` 0` to `'\ n'` or` EOF` respectively.
5. If the parameters have a problem (`BUFFER_SIZE <= 0`), or in any of these operations we are unable to allocate memory, we release all allocated memory and return` -1`.

Today I will not be able to code much for work and the CFC.
