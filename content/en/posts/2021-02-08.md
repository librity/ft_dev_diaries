Yesterday I finished the libft bunus, corrected the tests that were failing and made the first correction.

If I open a slot I plan to make the second correction today.

This week and next I will take classes to get the license, and I will be unavailable after 7pm. My biggest impediment is to find a correction slot before 7pm.
