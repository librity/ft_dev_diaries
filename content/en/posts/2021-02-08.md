Yesterday I finished all of libft's bonuses, fixed all test failures and passed my first evaluation.

If I can catch a slot today I'll be halfway through my corrections.

For the next couple of weeks I'll be taking Driver's ed at night, and I'll be unavailable after 7pm.
My biggest obstacle was finding open evaluation slot before 7pm.
