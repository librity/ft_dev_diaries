Yesterday I finished the integer conversion with all the possible flag
combinations.
I'm very happy that part's over and I'm pretty sure I'm 70% done:
The other conversions are pretty similar to int except they have
less corner cases, so it should be very easy to port my padding logic to them.

My flag parser ended up very robust with all the refactoring and restructuring.
The last challenging thing I have left is handling all the flags for
the `%s` conversion.

Today I'll keep working on printf.
I really want to finish it as soon as possible.

I might do a ReactJS challenge from a bootcamp I'm doing to take a break from C.
