Yesterday I finished some React challenges from the bootcamp I'm doing.
I also learned about `Bounding volume hierarchy` and `The Rendering Equation`.

A `Bounding volume hierarchy` is a tree structure that
delimits the objects we need to render in a scene.
Each node in this tree is either an object that we might have to render,
or a virtual object that contains more than one object.

If we cast a ray and we hit a node in the tree
we know we only have to care about the object below that node,
and reduce the amount of objects we need to check.
It's a basic optimization that drastically increases performance
as the scenes have more objects
and as the objects become more complex (with different textures and polygons).

The `Rendering Equation` is a simple but complete model
of how ray-tracing works:

The term on the left

{{< figure src="/images/2021-03-22/rednering_equation_total_spectral_radiance.svg"
           alt="Total spectral radiance term" height="50" >}}

represent the `spectral radiance` of an arbitrary ray we cast.
In computer terms the spectral radiance is pretty much the `rgba`,
the hue we calculate for the ray.
The aim of a ray-tracing engine is to solve for this hue
for each pixel on a canvas/screen.

The first term on the right

{{< figure src="/images/2021-03-22/rednering_equation_emitted_spectral_radiance.svg"
           alt="Emitted spectral radiance term" height="50" >}}

is called the `emitted spectral radiance`, which is basically the ambient light.

The second term on the right

{{< figure src="/images/2021-03-22/rednering_equation_integral_over_unit_hemisphere.svg" alt="Integral over unit hemisphere term" height="50" >}}

represent the the entire interaction between the ray
and the surface it's trying to render.
There's a lot of interesting physical phenomena that this term takes into account:

- the incidence of the ray with the normal of the surface at the point of intersection

  {{< figure src="/images/2021-03-22/rednering_equation_weakening_factor.svg"
             alt="Weakening factor term" height="50" >}}

  which reduces the overall radiance as the angle increases.

- the amount of light reflected back to origin of the ray at the point of intersection

  {{< figure src="/images/2021-03-22/rednering_equation_incoming_spectral_radiance.svg"
             alt="Incoming spectral radiance term" height="50" >}}

  which in itself is another ray-tracing problem.
  There's usually a lot of recursion and parallelism in ray-tracing engines.

- the `bidirectional reflectance distribution function`

  {{< figure src="/images/2021-03-22/rednering_equation_bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function.svg"
             alt="Bidirectional reflectance distribution function term" height="50" >}}

  is basically how we account for light effects on different surfaces:
  glossy, mirror reflections, matte/not glossy, and others.

Today I'm gonna do some Node and Elixir Challenges from my bootcamp.
I wanna get those out of the way quickly and start focusing on the Ray Tracer.
