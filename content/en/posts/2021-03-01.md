Yesterday I finished the last NLW track.
I made an NPS backend with Node and Express.
I came to the conclusion that node is terrible for backends and we should
stop using it.
It's just a big old mess of packages that work half the time, and nothing ever
has any structure.
Javascript is also a very ugly language and it hurts my eyes.
I don't have much interest in doing another backend in node. I might try nest.js,
but I'm pretty sure that GO, Clojure and Elixir are always better alternatives.

Today I'm going to work at printf.
