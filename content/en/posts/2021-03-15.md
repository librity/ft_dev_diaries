Yesterday I implemented formatting on everything except strings,
and my printf is passing on 80% of all tests!
I'm so glad this I'm almost done with this project.

I did learn a lot about structuring, debugging and refactoring,
but it wasn't a neat project with an intuitive solution:
I spent a total of 70 hours running my code over and over again
to make it match poorly documented and arbitrary specs.

I guess it's a right of passage around here:
It's the first big project we do with lots of moving pieces.

I'm planning on opening a pull-request on
[42docs](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/projects/get_next_line)
with my take and tips on the subject, especially the weird flag combinations.

Today I'll hopefully finish the string conversions and get it ready for review.
