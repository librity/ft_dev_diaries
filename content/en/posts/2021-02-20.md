Yesterday I managed to get my `get_next_line` working!

Today I'm going to refactor it, correct all norminette errors and debug it with the github testers.

My biggest obstacle was breaking it into smaller functions as it has to pass a
lot of pointers to its sub-functions. Looking back now, I should have used a
struct, and I will when I refactor it again.
