Yesterday I finished all the Elixir challenges from the bootcamp I'm doing.
I also created a rails app to help me manage my studies (W.I.P):

Today's my birthday and I took a few hours off to celebrate.
I played Wind Waker and had a blast.

I made some good progress on my printf:
I refactored lot of my code and it's passing more tests.

I also learned that `long` and `long int` are the same thing:

I'm having a hard time handling all the flag combinations since implementing
one usually breaks the other.
