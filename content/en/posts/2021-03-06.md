Yesterday I made more progress on printf:
It's already handling all the flags except for the wildcard `'*'`, which is the hardest.
I also learned that some constant are located in different headers depending on the OS.
A good example of this is `ARG_MAX`, that's can be found in `limits.h` on macOS,
and in `linux/limits.h` on linux.
For portability reasons it's a really good idea to check and include the
system-appropriate headers in your projects, especially if you're developing on
linux (like I am).

```c
# include <limits.h>

# ifdef __linux__
# include <linux / limits.h>
# endif
```

I hope to finish the printf by tomorrow if possible.
