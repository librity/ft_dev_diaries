Yesterday I went to printf: my printf is already making all the flags except the wildcard `'*'`, which is the most difficult. I also learned that there are some settings that are in different headers depending on the system. An example is`ARG_MAX`, which have` limits.h`in macos, and`linux / limits.h` in linux.
For portability reasons it is legal to check and include the appropriate header in the projects, especially for those who are doing it in linux.

I hope to finish the printf by tomorrow.

```c
# include <limits.h>

# ifdef __linux__
# include <linux / limits.h>
# endif
```
