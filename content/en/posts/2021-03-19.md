Yesterday I fixed all bugs on my printf.
It's now passing on all tests, and I'll do my first evaluation today.

I learned many of the differences between Linux's
and MacOS's implementations of printf:

- Linux doesn't handle precision for `"(null)"` string.
- Linux prints `"(nil)"` when the `%p` conversion receives a `NULL` pointer.

Today I'll plan on doing all of my printf's evaluations
and start researching the next project: `MiniRT`.
I'll also setup the official VM, which is used in this project.
