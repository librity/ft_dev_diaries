title: "Formatting strings"

Yesterday I implemented string formatting on my printf.
I thought the string formatting was gonna take longer,
but it was way easier than handling ints:
The precision just delimits how many characters you print,
and there are far less flag combinations to worry about.

It's now passing 95% of tests.
The ones that aren't passing are mostly due to
differences between the MacOS and Linux implementations of printf.

I'm currently debugging it in a MacOS environment through ssh,
and I'm learning how to use debug tools from the command line.

Today I'll clean up all the bugs, extract all the new libft functions I wrote
and separate libft from ft_printf
(right now they're all in a single directory, header file and Makefile).

I'm pretty sure I'll start the evaluations today.
After I'm done with the project I'll add printf and get_next_line to my libft.

I'm proud of all the utility functions I wrote during the project,
dealing with different types
and reducing the complexity of freeing variables.
Surprisingly, I ended up implementing printf without a single heap allocation,
which simplifies a lot of stuff
and makes it run super fast.

My greatest obstacle is debugging it from the shell,
but it's helping me git gud at Emacs and GDB;
I hate vim and I'm never gonna use that thing.
