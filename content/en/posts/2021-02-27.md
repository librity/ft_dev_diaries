Yesterday I made a basic payments API with Elixir and Phoenix as part of
Rocket Seat's Next Level Week:
a free workshop where they teach web technologies.
It was my first time with Elixir and I absolutely loved the language.
I learned several new concepts of functional programming that will help me with
my future 42 projects.

Today I'm gonna start the next two NLW "tracks": Node and React.
I'll also give netwhat another shot, and if I have any time left I'll work on printf.
