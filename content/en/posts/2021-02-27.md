Yesterday I did the Elixir track by NLW from Rocket Seat. I made a very basic payments api. It was the first time that I touched Elixir, and I loved the language. I learned several concepts and good functional programming practices that helped me with 42 projects.

Today I'm going to do the other two NLW tracks: Node and React. I will also do netwhat, and if I have time to continue working on printf.
