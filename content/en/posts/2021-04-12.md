Yesterday I made a discord bot with Javascript:

- https://github.com/librity/shiffman_discord_bot

I woke up early today and evaluated 4 rush projects
from the ongoing basecamp at 42 SÃ£o Paulo.
This rush is not easy at all and almost all groups fail it.

It wasn't as fun as last weeks correction
since most of the projects were either empty or incomplete.
I'm really out of my element when there's not much code to review and refactor.

I'm also gonna do the last module of the Elixir bootcamp.
It's a really short module and it doesn't have any challenges;
It covers github actions and deploying with Gigalixir.
