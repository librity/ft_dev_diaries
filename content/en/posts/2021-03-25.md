Yesterday I studied Elixir and learned new syntax tricks like `Comprehensions`.

Today I'm refactoring and restructuring my projects.
I'm also writing some pretty READMEs for each one.

I read the first part of `The Ray Tracer Challenge` book, and I think it's
a bit to dense to start with.

I'm gonna do
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
first because it's shorter and has code examples.
I'm gonna implement it all on C,
and I'm gonna start with the `3dvector` library.
