I started doing get_next_line yesterday. I have a pretty good idea of ​​what to do. I'm looking for a way to advance the position of the file descriptor in `read`.
I'm also trying to understand how I'm going to allocate enough memory for an entire line, since I can only read `BUFFER_SIZE` bytes at a time, and the line can be longer than the `BUFFER_SIZE`.

I won't be able to code much today due to lingering reasons.

My biggest obstacle so far was the lack of context: get_next_line is like a
`getc` thar read the entire line.
