Yesterday I started get_next_line. I already have a good idea of ​​what to do. I am finding a way to advance the position of the file descriptor in `read`.
I'm also trying to understand how I'm going to allocate enough memory for an entire line, since I can only read `BUFFER_SIZE` bytes at a time, and the line can be longer than this` BUFFER_SIZE`.

Today I will not be able to code much for work and the CFC.

My biggest impediment was the lack of context: get_next_line is like a `getc` so it takes the entire line.
