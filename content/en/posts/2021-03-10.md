title: "Thread-safety"

Yesterday I studied concurrency and parallelism in Elixir.
I wanna do a C tutorial exploring these concepts as well.

Writing thread-safe code in C is extremely hard and almost outdated after Rust.
Despite this, I believe there's a lot of value to it:
writing thread-safe code in C gives us a deep understanding of how computers
work and how we can optimize them on different domains.

I also created a deploy-ready Hugo template repo:
If you wanna get a static site up and running on Netlify without configuring
a ton of stuff just fork and deploy it.

Today I'll finish some Elixir challenges from my bootcamp, add a couple
features to a Rails app I've been working on and work on printf.
