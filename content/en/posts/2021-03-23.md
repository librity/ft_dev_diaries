Yesterday I finished an Elixir module of the bootcamp I'm doing
and its respective challenges: I created an Elixir web API with Phoenix.

Phonenix is an amazing web framework made with Elixir,
and it follows many of the conventions that Rails established.
If you're a rails developer looking to get into functional programming
you're gonna love Phoenix and Elixir, I know I am.

Today I'm gonna finish the challenges
and cleanup some of my git repos (add github actions, improve the READMEs, etc.)

I might do challenges from other modules of the bootcamp,
or I might work on miniRT, I'm not sure yet.
