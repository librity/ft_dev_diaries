Yesterday I refactored and corrected (almost) all the debugs on my get_next_line.
I also created a script that setups and runs all the tests automatically:

- https://github.com/librity/ft_get_next_line/blob/main/github_testers.sh

Today I'm gonna fix what's left to fix on get_next_line consider whether or not
it's worth it to do the bonus part.

Some of the testers don't give you a lot of feedback when they fail.
My biggest challenges was plowing through the tester's messy code to try and
understand what was failing.
