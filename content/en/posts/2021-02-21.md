Yesterday I refactored and corrected (almost) all the errors of get_next_line. I also created a script to facilitate the tests of the project:

- https://github.com/librity/ft_get_next_line/blob/main/github_testers.sh

Today I'm going to make get_next_line pass the missing tests and evaluate if it's worth making the bonus.

My biggest impediment was to open the automatic tests to see what was failing.
