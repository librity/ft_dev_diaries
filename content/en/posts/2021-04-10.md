Yesterday I learned about how processes work in the BEAM machine.
I re-implemented stacks and queues without `GenServer`.
It's not that involved, you just spawn a recursive loop
that awaits instructions from the process' message box and changes the state.

Today I'll continue reading Elixir in Action (I'm halfway through),
do some NodeJS challenges and work on my ray tracer.
