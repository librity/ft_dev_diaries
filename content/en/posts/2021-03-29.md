I made a lot of progress on the Weekend Ray Tracer.
I'm on chapter 9 and I've learned a lot about image processing:

- I've created a robust linear algebra library full of utility functions.
- I've abstracted many of the functions of a ray tracer in modules
  (rays, camera, color, geometry, hit record, math, random numbers, etc.)
- I learned how to color surfaces
  by the normal of the intersection with the ray,
  which really grooves-up the effects:

- I learned how to handle multiple objects in a scene using only linked list,
  my record being 3000!

- I've implemented anti-aliasing, sampling and gamma correction.
- I learned about hidden surfaces
  and the associated effects we use to render them,
  like diffusing rays to create matte surfaces.

I could go on longer, but you get the point:
the project is very involved and very rewarding.

It's a bit of a challenge "transpiling" all the C++ examples to C
while at the same time managing the restrictions imposed by the final project.
With a few exceptions I can't use any external functions or libraries,
and everything has to follow 42's Norme.

This restrictions are really sharpening my skills,
and I can tell that my code is getting better by the hour.
I realize now how C++ is relatively high in abstraction compared to C;
There's a bunch of simple operations with vectors
that take 5+ lines to implement,
and all the C++ headers and classes would cut some of my functions by half.

I'm really enjoying `miniRT` project so far,
and I'm enjoying it a lot more than `printf`.
I've messed with the effects for hours and generated a hundreds of cool images.

Today I'm gonna plow through the new module of the Elixir bootcamp I'm doing.
It'll probably take me a couple of days to do all the classes and challenges.
