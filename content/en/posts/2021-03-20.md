Yesterday I did al three evaluations and completed ft_printf.
It was a big project my first milestone in 42:
It was the first time I felt properly challenged and out of my comfort zone.

I installed the official 42 VM, which is used on all the projects from here on out.
It was way easier than I thought it would be.
I'm not gonna use it for development since I run Ubuntu on my machine
and the packages are completely compatible;
I'm just gonna use it for tests and evaluations.

I also started researching my next project: `miniRT`.
It's a ray tracer in C that renders spheres, plans, squares, cylinders
and triangles with different light sources and camera positions.

It uses a window API developed by [42paris](https://github.com/42Paris)
called [miniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).
I installed it on my machine and on the official VM,
and messed around with it for a while.

I'm studying its
[unofficial documentation](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html)
made by 42 CODAM students, and I'm already doing some basic things with it.

Today I'm gonna take some time off to celebrate this last victory,
then do a few things:

I'm gonna add printf and get_next_line to my libft,
and refactor it with the new techniques I've learned.
I'm separating the source files, the objects, the headers
and the `.a` libraries in different folders so it's more organized.

I'm also creating a C project template based on
[this one](https://github.com/dutenrapha/makefile)
by [@dutenrapha](https://github.com/dutenrapha).
He created a really good default structure that helped me organize my ft_printf.

As for the `miniRT`, I'm gonna start by implementing a random walker
using `miniLibX` and move on to other basic demo projects.
There's a bunch of coding challenges from
[the Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)
that'll help me get familiar with both `miniLibX` and `math.h`,
which I'll use extensively in the project.
