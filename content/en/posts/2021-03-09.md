Yesterday I learned about tail-call optimization in recursive functions:

- https://dino.codes/posts/tail-call-optimization-in-elixir/

The long and short of it is we can use accumulator variables to cut the
number of instructions executed on recursive calls.
I'm gonna use an Elixir example since optimizations in C depend a lot on the
compiler:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3514283/c-tail-call-optimization

```elixir
defmodule UnoptimizedSum do
  def call(list), do: sum(list)

  defp sum([]), do: 0
  defp sum([head | tail]), do: head + sum(tail)
end
```

In `UnoptimizedSum`, we only start adding the values after the last `sum()`
call:

```elixir
UnoptimizedSum.call([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
= 5 + UnoptimizedSum.sum([4, 3, 2, 1])
= 5 + (4 + UnoptimizedSum.sum([3, 2, 1]))
= 5 + (4 + (3 + UnoptimizedSum.sum([2, 1])))
= 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + UnoptimizedSum.sum([1]))))
= 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + (1 + UnoptimizedSum.sum([])))))
= 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + (1 + 0))))
= 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + 1)))
= 5 + (4 + (3 + 3))
= 5 + (4 + 6)
= 5 + 10
= 15
```

This means that the compiler will execute two instructions for every element of
the list: one for the `sum` call and one for the addition.

```elixir
defmodule OptimizedSum do
  def call(list), do: sum(list, 0)

  defp sum([], accumulator), do: accumulator
  defp sum([head | tail], accumulator), do: sum(tail, accumulator + head)
end
```

Now in `OptimizedSum`, we add the values on every recursive call:

```elixir
OptimizedSum.call([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
= OptimizedSum.sum([4, 3, 2, 1], 5)
= OptimizedSum.sum([3, 2, 1], 9)
= OptimizedSum.sum([2, 1], 12)
= OptimizedSum.sum([1], 14)
= OptimizedSum.sum([], 15)
= 15
```

and we execute half the instructions for the same operation.
I thought it was a really neat trick and I'm gonna try and use it more often.

Today I'll keep on studying Elixir and working on printf.
