Yesterday I finished the Weekend Ray Tracer book.
I added dielectric materials and depth of field to my Ray Tracer:

I had a blast with this project,
and I'll be able to re-use most of the code on `minirt`.
If you're interested about the math
I explain most of the equations used in the projects README:

Today I'll probably start
[The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/)
book, which they recommend for the `minirt`.
I'll probably skip a chunk of it
since my ray tracer already handles most of what it needs to do.
My three challenges moving forward are:

- Initializing the objects from a `.rt` scene file.
- Adding different objects, like triangles, cubes and cylinders.
- Handling lights with different colors.

The first two are pretty straight forward,
but I'm out of my element on the third:
There's absolutely no light-handling on the one I did
and the logic behind that isn't very clear to me.

I'll probably mess around with it for a while
and try to add some basic lighting.
If it takes to long I'll hit the books.
