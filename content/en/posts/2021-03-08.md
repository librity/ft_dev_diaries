Yesterday I fixed a lot of bugs on my printf.
I'm pretty sure it'll be done by Wednesday at the latest.

I learned how to use `valgrind` and `gdb` in this projects.
They're amazing tools, and they're saving me a lot of time.

Did you know that you can run `gdb` on a `coredump` file to access the state
of your program before it crashed?

Today I will continue working on printf.
I'm also doing an Elixir course I bought the other week.

My gratest obstacle was figuring out all the flag combinations that printf handles.
It's very arbitraty how they interact with each-other, and I couldn't find any
tutorials online that explain this well.
I figured it out by trail and error, by running a ton of tests and examples.
