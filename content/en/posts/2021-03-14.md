Yesterday I did 4 challenges from my bootcamp.
I also isolated and refactored a bunch of stuff in my printf.

I really like the current structure of the project:
it's extremely organized, easy to read, easy to test and easy to debug.

The most important thing I learned during this project is that C is
very unforgiving to code smell.
It's easy enough as it is to get lost debugging something in well-written
C code;
debugging messy C code is so slow and tedious that you'll likely
put it off till never.

Today I'll start handling flags for all conversions except `%s`.
If I have time I'll start doing string conversions.
