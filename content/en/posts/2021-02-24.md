Yesterday I chipped on the netwhat test, and I will have to wait 3 days to try again: laughing:: tired_face:: rofl:
Since I can't sign up for another project until I finish this one, I started printf on my own: I studied various arguments with `stdarg.h` and added some functions to my libft.
The Git Workshop was awesome: the guy was a lot of mangia.

I intend to continue printf, starting by defining a scalable structure for it.

My biggest impediment is the netwhat retry time.
