Yesterday I ran out of time on the netwhat test, and I'll have to wait 3 days
to try it again. Since I can't sign up for another project until I finish this one,
I started printf on my own: I studied variadic arguments with `stdarg.h` and
added some functions to my libft.

We had an amazing Git Workshop with a veteran tech lead called
[Lucio Assis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucio-assis-4832705/).
We learned how git works under the hood and tons of useful commands.

I plan on doing printf today. The first thing I wanna do is give it some
structure since it will have a lot of parts and it can turn messy in a hurry.

My biggest obstacle is the netwhat retry time: 3 days is a bit too much.
